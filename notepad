### beautify rails console... Hirb.enable

### standings...
call method when Admin closes current week... calculate wins/losses
updates the table (10 games for standings plus tiebreaker game (11) if needed)

### selecting user's picks
I want all user picks
lk = User.find(1)
lk.picks

I want all games in a week
wk = Week.find_by(week:1)
wk.games

I want all the picks from a particular weekwk =
wk = Game.where(week_id:1)
wk.each do |w|
  wkpk = w.picks.where(user_id:1) OR wkpk = w.picks.find_by(user_id:1)
  puts wkpk[0].pick OR puts wkpk.pick
end

Putting it all together
wk = Week.find_by(week:2)
wk.games.each do |g|
  wkpk = Pick.find_by(game_id: g.id, user_id:2)
  puts wkpk.pick
end
